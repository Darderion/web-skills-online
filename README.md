> App for learning web-development

This website acts as a container for lots of educational videos. It compiles videos from different youtube channels based on their subjects and then arranges them so that beginners wouldn't get lost in oceans of information. It displays which subject each video covers, gives you a brief description of what to expect from given educational material and also tells you which videos you need to watch prior to watching certain pieces of content.
